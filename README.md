# Cortex neuroevolution platform

This platform supports evolving neural networks in an efficient manner. Advantages include explicit and automatic complexity-based speciation, minimal redundancy and an intuitive genotype representation.
A paper describing the idea behind it was published in 2016:

## Development status
Cortex is under active development, and the API is not completely stable. I have included a couple of experiments with the distribution, and I'm working on more, so stay tuned.

## Coding style
The aim is to write clean and readable code. Blocks start with a curly brace on a new line. The Ecosystem, Network, Neuron and Link class template hierarchy should be quite intuitive and easy to follow 
and extend.

A proper manual and some means of network/ecosystem visualisation (OpenGL and/or VTK) is on the TODO list.
