# Cortex neuroevolution platform

Cortex evolves neural networks efficiently by employing a complexity-based speciation paradigm
and an intuitive genotype representation with virtually no redundancy.

A number of improvements have been introduced since the initial implementation,
for example, the ability to add and remove neurons other than hidden ones.
Cortex supports both classical and spiking networks and can evolve both the topology and the parameters of the networks.
Agents are evaluated in parallel in separate threads.

## Development status
Cortex is under active development, and the API is not completely stable.
I have included a couple of experiments, and I'm working on more, so stay tuned.
