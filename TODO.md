# TODO List

## Core features
- Layered networks
    - CNN, LSTM, etc.
- Hybrid strategy employing both training and evolution
- Modules within networks
- Abstracting the network topology from the actual wiring
    - This would allow for quickly changing the topology (for example, from unordered to layered)
- Novelty search, substrates (a la HyperNEAT), CPPN

## C++
- Structured bindings in range `for` loops (`C++17`)

## Usability

### Short-term
- A proper manual (part of the API is already documented using Doxygen)

### Mid-term
- Network visualisation
- Python bindings
- GUI

### Long-term
- TensorFlow / BLAS integration
- GPU acceleration
